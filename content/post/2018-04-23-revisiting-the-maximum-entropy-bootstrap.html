<p>The basic bootstrap is a powerful and intuitive tool that can be used in many ways. The basic intuition is: given a random sample <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> from some population <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, we can resample from <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> with replacement to get a bootstrapped sample (let’s call it <span class="math inline">\(p_{b}\)</span>) that can be looked at as another sample from population <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>; that is, without seeing any more observations within the population of interest, we can construct many samples <span class="math inline">\(p_b\)</span> that approximate the overall population <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</p>
<p>Of course, there are assumptions that must be met to have sound bootstrap inference, but this is probably the cleanest display of the basic method. One assumption that I mentioned was that <span class="math inline">\(p_b\)</span> must be a random sample from <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span></p>
<p>There are many situations where you would want a replicated</p>
<p>My interests in resampling/non-parametric methods as well as time-series statistics led me to read about the Maximum Entropy Bootstrap, first developed by Vinod. I was drawn to this method for a couple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no intuitive ‘best’ method to bootstrap time series data; each method has different assumptions</li>
<li>uhh</li>
</ul>
<p>Another reason the ME bootstrap appeals to me is its</p>
<p>As cool as I think this method is, there are people way smarter than I that have voiced concerns over some of it’s properties – Russell Davidson notes that the replicates actually are <em>too</em> similar to the original data;</p>
<p>This begs the question – while the ME bootstrap may not be useful for estimating a population of potential (unrealized) time-series by which to test a hypothesis regarding the observed data, are there applications</p>
